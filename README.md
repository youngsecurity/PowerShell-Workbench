# PowerShell Workbench Software Repository

I use This software repository of PowerShell scripts for various system automation tasks. PowerShell 7+ is cross-platform, making it an excellent choice for people who prefer to work on the Windows platform and write code that runs cross-platform on Linux and macOS.

It is designed to make it easier for developers to automate software management and system configuration using PowerShell.

## Requirements

To use the PowerShell Workbench Software Repository, you must have PowerShell 7 or higher.

To perform some remote code execution tasks, I recommend "PSExec64.exe".

## Usage

Once you have PowerShell 7+ and PSExec64.exe installed, you can use any of the automation scripts in this repo to manage local and remote systems and software.

For example, to check your local system for Python and install the latest version of Python from the web, run the following command in PowerShell: `.\06-GetApps-Python.ps1`

## Disclaimer

The scripts contained in this repository are what I use every day to configure systems. They should all work and be free from errors, but if you experience errors, please submit an issue, and I will help you resolve it.

I develop these scripts for my personal use. Scripts may opinionated and specific to my environment and may require modification to work. I work to generalize as much as possible or prompt the end-user for information at the command line.

All code is considered a work in progress.
